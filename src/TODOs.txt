TODO list:

1. Replace simple error message displaying codes with exception generation.

2. Better to change the function name encode()/decode() to something like run() or something.

3. "HuffmanEncoder::encode()": If the previously compressed file is same then don't clear the internal tables. Re-use them.

4. Since the MinHeap API is GOOD now, finish the HuffmanEncoder module.
