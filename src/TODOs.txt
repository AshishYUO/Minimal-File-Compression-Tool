TODO list:

1. Replace simple error message displaying codes with exception generation.

2. Better to change the function name encode()/decode() to something like run() or something.

3. "HuffmanEncoder::encode()": If the previously compressed file is same then don't clear the internal tables. Re-use them.

4. Generate actual bit-sequence of the codewords.

5. get_compressed_byte_stream()


6. Unidentified bug at [hdr_2_bytes(): __base__ + 26]
  - For now it assumed to be good and left as is.
  - In future if any bug occurs that relate to this issue then immediate
    actions will be taken.
