TODO list:

1. Replace simple error message displaying codes with exception generation.

2. Better to change the function name encode()/decode() to something like run() or something.

3. "HuffmanEncoder::encode()": If the previously compressed file is same then don't clear the internal tables. Re-use them.

4. Generate actual bit-sequence of the codewords.

5. Finish get_compressed_byte_stream()+20


6. New solution found: Writing a structure with pointers inside it into a binary file can be done directly by file.write() function.
   No need to separately work on writing pointers. YEAAAYYY!!
   
7. Modify the following files and data structures:
   -> struct codeword_map_struct; (Remove)
   -> struct header_struct;       (Modify)
   -> metadata.{h,cpp}            (Remove and write afresh)
